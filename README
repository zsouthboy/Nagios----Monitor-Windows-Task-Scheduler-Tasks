Have a Windows task that ends up failing sometimes?
This script will help you monitor your other scripts/tasks that run on Windows boxes.


Python 2.x is required. Tested on 2.6.
Windows 2003R2 has been tested.
Should work on both 32 and 64bit versions of both.
Any Nagios version should work.

To use:

Copy the script into your NSClient++ scripts directory (Python 2.x is required) on the box you wish to monitor the tasks.

Edit the DICT_OF_TASKS dictionary at the beginning of the file to add the names of your tasks and the number of minutes in which they have not successfully run (exit code 0x0):
*Use the name, spaces and all, that is set in Task Scheduler
*You can use `schtasks /query /v /fo csv` to get a comma-separated list of your tasks from Task Scheduler

Edit your NSC.ini file to allow Nagios to invoke the script:
*Inside the [NRPE Handlers] section
*Add a line with the name you wish to use on the Nagios side, e.g. check_glue_scripts_via_tsched
*Set that line equal to scripts\check_windows_tasks_via_taskscheduler.py
**If python is not in your PATH, you probably need to call it explicitly like so:
**c:\python26\python.exe scripts\check_glue_scripts_via_tshed.py

Nagios configuration (XI and open source version):
(this will vary according to your own Nagios configuration)
*Add a service for your client box that uses NRPE to invoke the name you set earlier, check_glue_scripts_via_tsched for example
*No arguments are necessary to launch the script since your configuration has been done host-side

This script is being used in production and seems to work well, but YMMV and I am not responsible if anything goes wrong.
